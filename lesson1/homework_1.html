<p>Out of all the main characters there is no doubt about who the least intelligent person is. While he might be the most popular character to come from the show, Homer Simpson certainly isn't the brightest. He's incredibly clumsy, lazy, and lacks in common sense at times, but those characteristics all help make him as loveable as he is.

    Homer does have a few random moments of incredible intelligence, and when that happens it is normally a big surprise that leads to a comedic pay-off. His bright moments might be fleeting, with more "Doh's" than anything else, but he is still a fantastic character.</p>

<h2 style="background: #95e783" id="MS">Marge Simpson</h2>

<p>Marge Simpson has a tough job, keeping her family together as much as possible, despite how absolutely crazy the Simpson family can be. However, she does a great job of that and that is mainly down to her intelligence, as Marge is a fairly smart character.

    She might not be as smart as other people on the show who work in high-end jobs, but she certainly is intelligent. Marge knows how to fix human issues by talking to people, especially those within her family, which takes a lot of intelligence to be able to do.</p>
<h2 style="background: #ffec7b" id="BS">Bart</h2>

<p>Unfortunately for Bart Simpson, he takes after his father in many ways and one of those is that he's not exactly the smartest of people. Intelligence just doesn't come naturally for him and because of that, he resorts to humor as a coping mechanism, using pranks to entertain.

    While many might look at the pranks Bart does as borderline bullying at times (which is true in some instances), it is also a sign of intelligence. Bart has to put a lot of effort into some of them, and while he might not score great grades in school, his brains are used differently.</p>
<h2 style="background: #ffb1ff" id="LS">Lisa</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ec/Lisa_Simpson.png" alt="Lisa">
<p>She might be incredibly young, but Lisa Simpson is also incredibly smart. Out of her family, there's no doubt she's the brains of the bunch, whether it be with academic studies or music, Lisa just seems to have that natural gift where she is able to do things perfectly.</p>
